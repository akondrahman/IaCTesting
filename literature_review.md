This research emphasized on the importance of tools to automatically detect test smells as most of the times practitioners have little or no awareness about the smells in test code. Also it proved that, there are some relationships between production code smell and test code smell.

This research indicates that test smells can be introduced from the day to day coding practices of the testing proferssionals when they follow certain company, project or personal standards.

Presence of test smells endangers the maintainibility of the project and often create negative impact on the comprehension of the program.

This research indicates that there can be positive corelation between test smell and bug in production code. Also sometimes production system fault can be predicted from the existence of test smells in the test scripts. Also they reported that with the growth of the project test smells also grow in number.
